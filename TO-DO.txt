Deck:
	*Reordering from reveal menu does not work with mouse dragging, only touch gestures. Must support both.

Discard:
	*Allow to play flip cards from discard pile

Characters:
	*Allow for enemy controlled baku-gear. Have header button to display enemy gear menu
	
Energy:
	*Energized cards must be kept track of because they can be discarded and played from there

Misc:
	*Add end turn button, will clear batch, charge energy, and then draw a  card
	*Make mouse events work for re-ordering
	*Refactor code, way too many functions that can be consolidated
	*Constantly keep track of game-state in localStorage to continue match if page is refreshed
	*Make the character gear menu fit the display dynamically
	*Low quality card may be scaled incorrectly in some areas
