# Bakugan-Deck-Master
### What is this???
The Bakugan Deck Master is an unofficial companion app for the Bakugan TCG.
It aims to be a substitute for the standard 40-card deck required to play. This way you can play the game using only the Bakugan Toys, Cores, and Character Cards included when purchasing the toys!

I created this project to help the TCG become more accessible to all players, as I do think it is genuinely enjoyable and I want more people to have the opportunity to try it out!
