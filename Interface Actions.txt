BRAINSTORM FURTHER BEFORE ACTION.
THINK OF WHAT CAN BE INCLUDED ONLY IN THE DECK DAMAGE MENU


Deck (Brainstorming):
	*Draw to hand (amount, maybe option for 1 or range)
	*Send to discard (amount, maybe option for 1 or range. Should see each card before going to the next and have actions for it. Flip/fliphero!!). End if discard below 0
	*Energize top card(s) (Charged, uncharged)
	*View a certain amount of cards from top of deck and put them back (top, bottom, random)
	*Send to batch
	*Search deck and add card to hand, then shuffle
	*Reveal top (options: play if nonflip/fliphero, draw, discard, return to top, buttom, shuffle)
	*Search top (X) cards of deck (options: play, reorder (top/bottom (manual order), shuffle, top/bottom (rand order)) non-exclusive!!)
	*Draw to hand immediately after playing a flip

Energy:
	*Energized cards must be kept track of because they can be discarded and played from there.

Misc:
	*Hand privacy ability for revealing cards from hand/deck to opponent.
	*Header button Reveal Hand to show a flex of all cards in hand.
